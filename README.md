</p>

**ChessyNotCheesy** is a highly optimized, fully autonomous computer-vision based chess bot designed to play on Chess.com directly from your Linux desktop, powered by the **Stockfish** engine.

Unlike traditional chess bots or browser extensions that inject JavaScript, read browser memory, or hook into the DOM, **ChessyNotCheesy operates entirely outside the browser**. It acts exactly like a human player: it "looks" at your screen using native screen capture (`XShm` or `grim`) and "clicks" the mouse using hardware-level input simulation (a `/dev/uinput` virtual tablet driver).

## ✨ Features

- **100% External Vision System**: Uses OpenCV `TM_SQDIFF_NORMED` template matching to read the board visually. Completely immune to board highlights, last-move indicators, and square colors.
- **Universal Linux Support**: Fully supports both **X11** and **Wayland** display servers dynamically out-of-the-box!
- **CPU Efficient**: Built on lightweight native APIs (`XShm` on X11, `grim` on Wayland) and heavily optimized C++ OpenCV processing.
- **Human-like Interaction**: Uses a custom `/dev/uinput` absolute pointer device to simulate realistic, hardware-level mouse movements and clicks.
- **Built-in GTK3 GUI**:
  - Real-time PGN generation and tracking.
  - Live engine evaluation (e.g., `eval: +1.20`).
  - Adjustable Stockfish calculation depth (defaults to 4).
  - Configurable artificial delay between moves to mimic human thinking time.
  - Global Hotkeys: `` ` `` to start/stop, `C` to calibrate, `R` to reset game memory, `1` for White, `2` for Black, `LEFT SHIFT + -/+` to adjust min mouse delay, `CTRL + SHIFT + -/+` to adjust max mouse delay.
- **Robust State Engine**: Handles move parsing, en-passant, and castling rules seamlessly without parsing algebraic notation from the website DOM.

## 🛠️ Requirements & Dependencies
<details>
<summary><b>Requirements</b></summary>

### 🖥️ Requirements
This project is built exclusively for Linux and is fully tested on both **Arch Linux / X11** and **Arch Linux / Wayland (e.g. labwc, sway, hyprland)**. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Dependencies</b></summary>

### ⛓️ Dependencies
To compile and run this project, the following packages must be installed:
- `g++` (Compiler with C++17 support)
- `make`
- `stockfish` (Required for move calculation)
- `opencv` (libopencv-dev, specifically OpenCV 5 or compatible)
- `gtk3`
- `x11` and `xtst` (libxtst-dev)
- `grim` and `slurp` (Required for Wayland screen capture and calibration)

**Automated Installation (Arch Linux Only):**
An automated script is provided to install all necessary dependencies and system permissions:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```
*(If you are on Debian/Ubuntu or Fedora, you must manually install the equivalent packages (`build-essential`, `libopencv-dev`, `libxtst-dev`, `grim`, `slurp`, etc) and create your own udev rules).*

## 🚀 Getting Started
<details>
<summary><b>Option 1: Pre-compiled Releases (Recommended)</b></summary>

Whenever a new version is released, an automated GitHub Action compiles it and packages it. You can download the latest `.zip` archive directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/RiiK26/ChessyNotCheesy/releases).

1. Download `ChessyNotCheesy-linux-x86_64.zip`.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Run the installer script to set up dependencies, udev permissions (so the bot doesn't need `sudo`), and create a Desktop shortcut:
```bash
cd ChessyNotCheesy
./scripts/install.sh
```
4. You can now launch **ChessyNotCheesy** from your Desktop application menu
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2: Build from Source</b></summary>

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RiiK26/ChessyNotCheesy.git
cd ChessyNotCheesy
```
2. Run the installer to setup dependencies and udev permissions:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```
3. Compile the project:
```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```
4. Launch the bot:
```bash
./launcher.sh
```
</details>

## 🖥️ Application Scripts
We provide convenient scripts to manage your installation (located in the `scripts/` folder):

- **Install/Setup (`install.sh`)**: Installs Arch Linux dependencies, configures `udev` rules so the bot can listen to global hotkeys without requiring `sudo` on every launch, and creates a pure GUI desktop shortcut.
- **Update (`update.sh`)**: Automatically fetches the latest `.zip` release from GitHub, downloads it, extracts it, and overwrites your current installation seamlessly.
- **Uninstall (`uninstall.sh`)**: Removes the desktop shortcuts and cleans up the `udev` rules from your system.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Setup Chess.com**: 
   - Open a game on Chess.com.
   - **Important:** Set your piece style to **Neo** and board style to **Wood**. If you prefer other styles, you must update the templates in `themes/pieces/(add new themes folder for pieces here or board in board folder)` and adjust the [Default Config](themes/default.cfg).
   - Set move method to **Drag or Click**.
   - Set piece animation to **Slow** or **Medium** (Default).
   - Ensure the entire board is visible on your primary monitor without obstruction.

2. **Calibrate**:
   - In the GUI, click `(C)alibrate` or press the `C` hotkey.
   - **On X11**: Click exactly on the **Top-Left corner** of the board (the top-left edge of the `a8` square), then click the **Bottom-Right corner** (the bottom-right edge of the `h1` square).
   - **On Wayland**: Your screen will freeze. Click and drag a selection box perfectly over the entire chessboard to select the region.
   - The bot will automatically calculate square sizes and lock its vision onto the board.

3. **Play**:
   - Select your color side (`1` for White, `2` for Black).
   - Press the backtick `` ` `` key to start the bot.
   - Watch it play automatically!
   - When the game ends, press `R` to reset the bot's memory for the next game.
